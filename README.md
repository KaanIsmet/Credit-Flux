# Credit Flux: Smart Credit Card Rewards App

## What It Does
Credit Flux is an app that helps you get the most cash back and rewards from your credit cards. Think of it as your personal financial assistant that:

- **Tracks your spending** automatically
- **Suggests the best credit card** to use for each purchase
- **Maximizes your rewards** without the guesswork

Instead of manually figuring out which card gives you 3% back on groceries or 2% on gas, the app does it for you instantly.
